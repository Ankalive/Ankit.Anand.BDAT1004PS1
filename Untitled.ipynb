# Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, Honorificabilitudinitatibus, or
# Bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonn?

# Question 3
# Implement function triangleArea(a,b,c) that takes as input the lengths of the 3
# sides of a triangle and returns the area of the triangle. By Heron's formula, the area
# of a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c is
# s(s - a)(s -b)(s -c)
# , where
# s = (a+b+c)/2.
# >>> triangleArea(2,2,2)

# Question 4
# Write a program in python to separate odd and even integers in separate arrays. Go
# to the editor
# Test Data :
# Input the number of elements to be stored in the array :5
# Input 5 elements in the array :
# element - 0 : 25
# element - 1 : 47
# element - 2 : 42
# element - 3 : 56
# element - 4 : 32
# Expected Output:
# The Even elements are:
# 42 56 32
# The Odd elements are :
# 25 47

# Question 5
# a. Write a function inside(x,y,x1,y1,x2,y2) that returns True or False
# depending on whether the point (x,y) lies in the rectangle with lower left
# corner (x1,y1) and upper right corner (x2,y2).
# >>> inside(1,1,0,0,2,3)
# True
# >>> inside(-1,-1,0,0,2,3)
# False
# b. Use function inside() from part a. to write an expression that tests whether
# the point (1,1) lies in both of the following rectangles: one with lower left
# corner (0.3, 0.5) and upper right corner (1.1, 0.7) and the other with lower
# left corner (0.5, 0.2) and upper right corner (1.1, 2).

# Question 6
# 16. You can turn a word into pig-Latin using the following two rules (simplified):
# • If the word starts with a consonant, move that letter to the end and append
# 'ay'. For example, 'happy' becomes 'appyhay' and 'pencil' becomes 'encilpay'.
# • If the word starts with a vowel, simply append 'way' to the end of the word.
# For example, 'enter' becomes 'enterway' and 'other' becomes 'otherway' . For
# our purposes, there are 5 vowels: a, e, i, o, u (so we count y as a consonant).
# Write a function pig() that takes a word (i.e., a string) as input and returns its pigLatin form. Your function should still work if the input word contains upper case
# characters. Your output should always be lower case however.
# >>> pig('happy')
# 'appyhay'
# >>> pig('Enter')
# 'enterway'

# Question 7
# File bloodtype1.txt records blood-types of patients (A, B, AB, O or OO) at a clinic.
# Write a function bldcount() that reads the file with name name and reports (i.e.,
# prints) how many patients there are in each bloodtype.
# >>> bldcount('bloodtype.txt')
# There are 10 patients of blood type A.
# There is one patient of blood type B.
# There are 10 patients of blood type AB.
# There are 12 patients of blood type O.
# There are no patients of blood type OO.

# Question 8
# Write a function curconv() that takes as input:
# 1. a currency represented using a string (e.g., 'JPY' for the Japanese Yen or
# 'EUR' for the Euro)
# 2. an amount
# and then converts and returns the amount in US dollars.
# >>> curconv('EUR', 100)
# 122.96544
# >>> curconv('JPY', 100)
# 1.241401
# The currency rates you will need are stored in file currencies.txt:

# Question 9
# Each of the following will cause an exception (an error). Identify what type of
# exception each will cause.
# Trying to add incompatible variables, as in
# adding 6 + ‘a’
# Referring to the 12th item of a list that has only 10
# items
# Using a value that is out of range for a function’s
# input, such as calling math.sqrt(-1.0)
# Using an undeclared variable, such as print(x)
# when x has not been defined
# Trying to open a file that does not exist, such as
# mistyping the file name or looking in the wrong
# directory.

# Question 10
# Encryption is the process of hiding the meaning of a text by substituting letters in the
# message with other letters, according to some system. If the process is successful, no
# one but the intended recipient can understand the encrypted message. Cryptanalysis
# refers to attempts to undo the encryption, even if some details of the encryption are
# unknown (for example, if an encrypted message has been intercepted). The first step
# of cryptanalysis is often to build up a table of letter frequencies in the encrypted text.
# Assume that the string letters is already defined as
# 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Write a function called frequencies()
# that takes a string as its only parameter, and returns a list of integers, showing the
# number of times each character appears in the text. Your function may ignore any
# characters that are not in letters.
# >>> frequencies('The quick red fox got bored and went home.')
# [1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2,
# 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
# >>> frequencies('apple')
